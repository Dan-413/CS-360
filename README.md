## Mobile Architecture and Programming
**Requirements and Goals:**
The Weight Tracking Application aimed to address users' needs related to monitoring and managing their daily weight, setting goals, and visualizing progress. The primary goals included providing a user-friendly interface for weight entry, allowing users to set and track goals, and offering a visual representation of their weight history.

**Screens and Features:**
1. **Daily Weight Entry Screen:** To add new weight entries.
2. **Goal Setting Screen:** Allowing users to set and update their weight goals.
3. **Weight History Grid:** Displaying a grid of weight entries for users to view their progress.
4. **Notification Settings Screen:** Providing users the option to enable or disable SMS notifications.

**User-Centered UI:**
- The UI designs prioritized simplicity and clarity to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Large, readable text and intuitive icons were employed.

**Coding Approach:**
- Utilized the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for modular code organization.
- Followed best practices in Android development, including proper resource management and adherence to coding standards.
- Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the SQLite database.

**Testing:**
- Extensive unit testing was performed for critical functionalities.
- Emulator and physical device testing ensured compatibility across different Android versions.
- User feedback was actively sought during beta testing to identify and address potential issues.

**Importance of Testing:**
- Testing ensures that the code meets functional requirements and provides a reliable user experience.
- Identified and resolved bugs, improving the overall stability and performance of the app.

**Innovation to Overcome Challenges:**
- Innovated in the design phase by incorporating a progress bar to visually represent goal achievement.
- Implemented an intuitive notification settings screen for a seamless user experience.

**Success in Demonstrating Knowledge:**
The successful integration of the SQLite database to manage user data demonstrated proficiency in database design and management. Adhering to best practices in Android development, such as modular coding and user-centered design, reflected a well-rounded understanding of mobile app development principles.
